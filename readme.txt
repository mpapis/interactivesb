second release: 

copy to desired php folder, 
change rights for history.htm, mesage.htm, status.dat - allow write to them for all

for avoiding user name entrance each time use index.php?name=YourName

after a period of time try to clear history.htm, maybe as an cron task :)

corrected from first release:
 - write control focused on load
 - write control is cleared on IE (wasn't)
